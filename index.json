Recently, the L2HMC method demonstrated low autocorrelation and high expected sample size over various ill-conditioned energy landscapes (Levy et al. 2018). By training deep neural networks to maximize the expected squared jump distance, the MCMC kernel can more efficiently explore the distribution. While promising, the initial training time of their sampler is not accounted for and could pose problems in practice when applying L2HMC to new distributions. In this project, I set out to analyze the training time and performance of different neural networks on strongly correlated gaussian distributions. I also examine whether one L2HMC sampler can be used to sample from multiple similar distributions.\nBackground Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a type of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm where new states are proposed through Hamiltonian dynamics (Neal 2012). Given that we can write our target distribution as a function of an energy distribution $p(x) \\propto \\exp(-U(x))$, we can approximate hamiltonian dynamics to explore this distribution using a series of leapfrog updates as follows: \\begin{equation} v^{\\frac{1}{2}} = v - \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}\\partial_x U(x); \\quad x’ = x+\\epsilon v^{\\frac{1}{2}}; \\quad v’ =v-\\frac{\\epsilon}{2} \\partial_x U(x’). \\end{equation}\nL2HMC Algorithm The Learning to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (L2HMC) algorithm modifies the HMC dynamics using trained neural networks (Levy et al. 2018). The usual leapfrog update steps are modified by scaling functions S,Q,T. The function S scales the current position or momentum, the function Q scales the derivative, and the function T translates the new position or momentum vector. Levy et al. showed that these dynamics have tractible determinants of the jacobian and preserves the properties of a markov chain, while efficiently exploring the distribution it was trained on.\nThe way the sampler increases its efficiency is by training these dynamics functions to maximize the expected squared jump distance. The expected squared jump distance from one state vector $\\xi$ can be written in the form of equation below. \\begin{equation} ESJD := \\sum_{\\xi’} P(\\xi’|\\xi)\\lVert \\xi_x-\\xi_x’ \\rVert_2^2 \\end{equation}\nHere $\\xi_x$ denotes the position subcomponent of the full state vector.\nThe standard architecture for each network of the L2HMC sampler (for position and momentum updates) used by Levy et al. is defined as follows: Position, velocity, and time step of the sampler serve as the input variables. This input is sent through two fully connected (ReLU activation) layers using hidden layer width of 10 for most energy functions, and 100 for the 50-dimensional ill conditioned gaussian (ICG). The output from this step is fed separately into the final translation/scaling layers, S,Q,T. The networks were trained for 5,000 iterations.\nExperimental Setup The L2HMC repository from Levy et al. was forked and modified for the current project. Tests were run on Google Colab Pro with a Tesla P100 PCI-E GPU, Intel Xeon Processor, and 13 Gb of RAM.\nNetwork Width We first analyze how changing the width of the network affects both training and performance of the L2HMC sampler. We run 2500 training iterations of 200 L2HMC chains (this is effectively the batch size) for fully connected neural networks of hidden layer widths 5, 10, and 20. Loss and acceptance history, as well as total training time was recorded. Once the sampler is fully trained, auto-correlation and expected sample size (ESS) is also measured, again using 200 chains simualted for 2000 time steps. For the sake of time we limit our analysis to the 2-dimensional strongly correlated gaussian (SCG) from Levy et al., with variances along the eigenvectors of $10^2$ and $10^{-1}$.\nRotational Invariance Next we look at how well one L2HMC sampler can adapt to distributions similar to the one it was trained on. Ideally, one would like to train one sampler to perform well on an entire class of distributions, as opposed to retraining each time. While there are many ways one distribution can be similar to another, in this project we focus on rotations of the same distribution. For our tests we use the SCG distribution whose covariance matrix is rotated by a certain degree. An example of this rotation is provided in figure 1.\nStrongly correlated gaussians offset 30 degrees from one another. We consider the blue distribution to be the original (0 degree rotation) We first determine how well a sampler trained on our original SCG performs on rotated distributions of increasing degree. By estimating at what point the sampler’s performance drops off, we can get a sense of its “operational range”. Most likely the limits determined here in the low dimensional setting upper bound those in the high dimensional setting, as many …","date":1619481600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619481600,"objectID":"53fb7712658330ccc0ef666f7e15748b","permalink":"https://evbecker.github.io/project/l2hmc/","publishdate":"2021-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/l2hmc/","section":"project","summary":"Analyzing the rotation invariance of the L2HMC Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler with neural network dynamics","tags":["Statistics","Deep Learning"],"title":"Taking the L2HMC Sampler for a \"Spin\"","type":"project"},{"authors":["Evan W.
